        <p>
          I love to binge watch movies and tv shows especially with my family.
          From anime, sci-fi, and comic book fantasy shows to classic comedy,
          action, and romance movies of the early 2000s.

        <p>
          Once work, school, and around the house to do lists are completed ...
          my sons and I have game night. That includes PC and console gaming on
          steam or which ever console we feel most excited to use.

          Electronics aside. The family loves to cure the eye fatigue and strain
          by getting out on our bikes and trail ride. The look, feel, and sound
          of nature is our way of relieving stress while getting some exercise.
